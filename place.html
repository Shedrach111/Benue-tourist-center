            the reserve was handed back to benue State Government. Today Montane is an important tourism destination in the country,

            by the master potter and an international ceramic icon, Mr. Levi O’bem Yakubu. a graduate of Ahmadu Bello University and a 
            former Ceramics Lecturer at the Benue State Polytechnic formerly known as Murtala College of science and technology then.

            banning of importation of table ware ceramics in the country in 1984. <br>
